# Restaurant Takeout App

**Note:** This repo contains a team project, the parts I (Brent Simons) worked on are the: Review section of the flutter app, the entire AR app.

This repository contains the code for our restaurant takeout application project, created as part of the Mobile Development & AR course. The project involves the development of two applications: one built with Flutter and the other with Wikitude.

## Overview

The project focuses on providing a seamless user experience for customers to view the restaurant's menu, place orders for takeout, manage user accounts, and leave reviews. The Wikitude application offers a unique AR experience, allowing users to scan specific dishes from a poster and instantly place orders for takeout.

## Features

- View the restaurant's complete menu and categorize dishes by different sections.
- Place orders for takeout directly from the menu and receive a designated pickup time.
- Manage user accounts, including personal details and preferences.
- Leave and browse reviews for the restaurant and individual dishes.

## Installation

To run the Flutter application, make sure you have Flutter installed on your local machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the Flutter app directory.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
4. Connect a device or use an emulator.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the application.

## Wikitude Integration

The Wikitude integration offers an immersive AR experience for users. It allows them to scan specific dishes from a poster and place orders for takeout directly. The app communicates with the same API used by the Flutter application, ensuring a synchronized experience for the users.
